three types of users: administrator, waiter and chef.
The administrator can do the following operations on the products from the menu:
• add
• delete

The waiter can do the following operations:
• create a new order for a table
• add elements from the menu
• compute the bill for an order
The chef is notified each time it must cook food that is ordered through a waiter.
